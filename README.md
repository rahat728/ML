# Career Acceleration Challenge

## Overview
This repository documents my **120-day Career Acceleration Challenge**, focused on building strong, industry-ready Python and backend development skills. The journey emphasizes disciplined problem-solving, object-oriented programming (OOP), real-world project workflows, and deployment readiness.

The program is designed to prepare me for **remote internships or junior roles** in:
- Python Development
- Data Science / ML Engineering
- AI-focused software roles

---

## Learning Objectives
- Build strong Python fundamentals with zero copy-pasting
- Develop clean thinking using OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism
- Follow professional development workflows
- Prepare for technical interviews and remote job readiness

---

## Program Roadmap

### Month 1 — Core Python & OOP Foundations
- Python basics (types, control flow, loops, data structures)
- Daily micro-challenges
- Writing clean, readable, typed code

### Month 2 — Advanced OOP & Professional Practices
- Advanced function design
- Error handling & robustness
- Developer discipline and best practices

### Month 3 — Project-Based Learning
- Collaborative-style projects
- Schema design (Prisma concepts)
- Docker fundamentals
- UI & system-level thinking

### Month 4 — Production Applications
- Django backend development
- Streamlit apps
- Local & cloud deployment (Google Cloud / local hosting)
- ERP-style and MBB-inspired system discussions
