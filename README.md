# Career Acceleration Challenge

## Overview
This repository documents my **120-day Career Acceleration Challenge**, focused on building strong, industry-ready Python and backend development skills. The journey emphasizes disciplined problem-solving, object-oriented programming (OOP), real-world project workflows, and deployment readiness.

The program is designed to prepare me for **remote internships or junior roles** in:
- Python Development
- Data Science / ML Engineering
- AI-focused software roles

---

## Learning Objectives
- Build strong Python fundamentals with zero copy-pasting
- Develop clean thinking using OOP principles:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Abstraction
  - Polymorphism
- Follow professional development workflows
- Prepare for technical interviews and remote job readiness

---

## Program Roadmap

### Month 1 — Core Python & OOP Foundations
- Python basics (types, control flow, loops, data structures)
- Daily micro-challenges
- Writing clean, readable, typed code

### Month 2 — Advanced OOP & Professional Practices
- Advanced function design
- Error handling & robustness
- Developer discipline and best practices

### Month 3 — Project-Based Learning
- Collaborative-style projects
- Schema design (Prisma concepts)
- Docker fundamentals
- UI & system-level thinking

### Month 4 — Production Applications
- Django backend development
- Streamlit apps
- Local & cloud deployment (Google Cloud / local hosting)
- ERP-style and MBB-inspired system discussions

## Daily Progress Log

- **Day 1 — 2025-12-15**  
  Completed micro-challenges: identity swap, type auditor, precision banker, modulo architect.

- **Day 2 — 2025-12-16**  
  Implemented logic flow tasks: guard clause, floating point trap, truthiness inspector, ternary packer.

- **Day 3 — 2025-12-17**  
  Mastered loop patterns: infinite guardian, accumulator pattern, efficient skipper, string walker.

- **Day 4 — 2025-12-18**  
  Worked with lists: reference trap, slicing surgeon, stack emulator, list comprehension architect.

- **Day 5 — 2025-12-19**  
  Dictionary challenges: optimized lookup, safe access, frequency counter, data merge logic.

- **Day 6 — 2025-12-20**  
  Functions & scope: scope fortress, pure return logic, default arguments, `is_even` gate.

- **Day 7 — 2025-12-21**  
  Error handling: input validation, math safety, cleanup with `finally`, custom exceptions.

- **Day 9 — 2026-01-09**  
  Mastered Generators: basic yield, memory profiling, infinite sequences (Fibonacci), exhaustibility, pipeline chaining, large file handling, `yield from` delegation, and two-way communication with `.send()`.

- **Day 10 — 2026-01-11**  
  Deep Dive into Decorators: manual wrappers vs. syntax sugar, handling `*args` and `**kwargs`, return value mechanics, performance timing (AOP), gatekeeper guards, memoization caching, metadata preservation with `functools.wraps`, stacked decorators, and decorator factories.

- **Day 11 — 2026-01-12**  
  Functional Programming Mastery: implemented micro-challenges for anonymous functions (`lambda`), `map`, `filter`, `reduce` (collapsing lists), `zip` (dictionary building), custom sorting keys, list comprehension performance, short-circuiting logic with `any`/`all`, partial functions (freezing arguments), and the core principle of functional immutability.

- **Day 12 — 2026-01-13**
  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Blueprint: implemented `User` class basics, `self` reference mechanics, string representation (`__str__`/`__repr__`), encapsulation with private variables (`__password`), `@property` decorator for computed attributes, class vs instance variables, inheritance (`Admin` subclass), `super()` proxy for parent verification, operator overloading (`__add__`), and equality comparison (`__eq__`).

- **Day 13 — 2026-01-17**
  Persistence & Context Managers: mastered file I/O safety with `with open(...)`, appended vs wrote data, handled binary streams (images), fixed `UnicodeDecodeError` encoding issues, serialized complex data with JSON and CSV, optimized I/O with buffering, managed paths cross-platform with `pathlib`, built custom context managers with `__enter__`/`__exit__`, and explored object serialization risks with `pickle`.
