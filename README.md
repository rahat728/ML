# Career Acceleration Challenge

## Description
This repository tracks my 120-day journey in the Career Acceleration Program, focusing on building professional Python skills, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism), Django projects, Streamlit apps, and cloud deployment (local and Google Cloud). It simulates industry workflows, including schema design with Prisma, Docker setup, and front-end UI, to prepare for remote jobs in ML engineering, data science, or AI.

## Personal Goals
- Master Python typing speed and avoid copy-pasting to build a developer mindset.
- Complete weekly official tasks from the PDF handbook and bonus practices.
- Deploy a production-level Django project by month 4.
- Secure a remote internship or contractual scholarship (e.g., $500–$3000) in the UK, Canada, or similar.
- Prepare for interviews with 1500+ practice questions and mock sessions.

## What This Covers
- **Month 1:** Python basics, weekly page-by-page tasks, OOP fundamentals.
- **Month 2:** Advanced OOP, developer professionalism, extra practices for enhancement.
- **Month 3:** Collaborative projects, use case studies, schema/Docker/UI design.
- **Month 4:** Django applications, local/cloud deployment.

## Daily Tracking

- **02. Day 2 - 2025-12-15** - Completed logic flow: guard clause, floating point trap, truthiness, ternary.
- **03. Day 3 - 2025-12-16** - Completed loops: infinite guardian, accumulator, skipper, string walker.
- **04. Day 4 - 2025-12-17** - Completed lists: reference trap, slicing, stack, list comprehension.
Use this section to log progress. Update after each day with date and key achievements.
